        <p>
          Inference Street Alpha is an internal, proprietary program used to guide our research and technology decisions. It is
          not a product we market or offer to clients. The program is rules-based and focused on liquid US equities and equity

              Explicit risk budgets at the position, sector, and portfolio levels, with volatility-aware sizing and pre-defined

            <li>
              Automatic drawdown controls, hard stop-outs on system behavior, and conservative gross and net exposure limits.

            <li>
              Data sourced from reputable market providers with validation, cleaning, and monitoring before it is used in
              production research or trading.
            </li>
            <li>
              Continuous integration for simulations and risk tests to detect code drift, broken assumptions, or unexpected
              behavior before it shows up in live capital.
            </li>
            <li>
              Execution and risk monitoring with real-time alerting, circuit breakers, and explicit capital preservation
              thresholds that halt or scale down the program if breached.
            </li>

          <li>Designed around clear holding-period bands and capital turnover targets, not open-ended positions.</li>

        <p>
          Beats67 is our experimental AI music studio. It lets creators generate songs about their lives, interests, and stories
          — safely and playfully. Today, Beats67 is used as an internal prototype and testbed for our generative media stack.

          <p>Future directions include a mobile or web app, classroom-friendly modes, and personalized experiences like birthday songs or “life code” tracks.</p>
          <p>Beats67 extends Inference Street’s capabilities beyond markets into generative media, leveraging the same engineering discipline we apply in trading — versioned models, careful evaluation, and a strong focus on safety.</p>
          <p>
            Lessons from Beats67 feed back into our client work on AI content pipelines, safety systems, and agentic media
            workflows.
